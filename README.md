## Code Overview

The main functionality of the game is controlled through JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the code structure:

- **Character Class**: The `Character` class defines the attributes and methods for each character, including their name, power, health, attack, health regeneration, and health check.
- **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are set up to handle attack and health button clicks for both characters.
- **Winner Announcement**: A winner message is dynamically created and appended to the HTML when one of the characters' health reaches zero.
